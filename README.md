# Code_NodeMCU_Alexa_Arduino_IotCloud_4Relays
 This project integrates an ESP8266 microcontroller with the Arduino IoT Cloud for controlling multiple devices via Alexa or other smart platforms.

# 🔶Folder ➜ Code_NodeMCU_Alexa_ArduinoIotCloud_4Relays:
⚠️this folder have 3 files and 1 picture , lets explain this files

  1. arduino_secrets.h: Contains sensitive details such as Wi-Fi credentials (SSID, PASS) and a secret device key used for secure IoT communication​.

  2. thingProperties.h: Initializes IoT properties and configurations, linking cloud-controlled switches (like lights, fans, etc.) with the Arduino IoT Cloud. It defines events for device state changes and sets up a Wi-Fi connection handler​.

  3. Code_NodeMCU_Alexa_ArduinoIotCloud_4Relays.ino: Implements the core logic to manage relays connected to appliances. This script facilitates device control via Alexa and synchronizes with the IoT Cloud.
     
  4. this picture explain how we connect our devices
