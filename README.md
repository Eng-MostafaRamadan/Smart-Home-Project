# Code_NodeMCU_Alexa_Arduino_IotCloud_4Relays
 This project integrates an ESP8266 microcontroller with the Arduino IoT Cloud for controlling multiple devices via Alexa or other smart platforms.

# üî∂Folder ‚ûúCode_NodeMCU_Alexa_ArduinoIotCloud_4Relays:
‚ö†Ô∏èthis folder have 3 files and 1 picture , lets explain this files

  1. arduino_secrets.h: Contains sensitive details such as Wi-Fi credentials (SSID, PASS) and a secret device key used for secure IoT communication‚Äã.

  2. thingProperties.h: Initializes IoT properties and configurations, linking cloud-controlled switches (like lights, fans, etc.) with the Arduino IoT Cloud. It defines events for device state changes and sets up a Wi-Fi connection handler‚Äã.

  3. Code_NodeMCU_Alexa_ArduinoIotCloud_4Relays.ino: Implements the core logic to manage relays connected to appliances. This script facilitates device control via Alexa and synchronizes with the IoT Cloud.

   ‚öÄ Key Features:‚Äã\n
      ‚á® Components Used:‚Äã\n
         1. 4x4 Matrix Keypad: Allows user input for the password.‚Äã\n
         2. LCD Display: Displays messages and feedback to the user.‚Äã\n
         3. Servo Motor: Controls the locking and unlocking of the door.‚Äã\n
         
   ‚öÅ Password Protection:
      1. A predefined password ("123*#") is stored in the program.
      2. The system compares the user‚Äôs input with the predefined password.
      3. If the password matches, the door unlocks; otherwise, it displays an error message.
      
   ‚öÇ Servo Motor Control:
      1. ServoOpen(): Unlocks the door by rotating the servo to an open position.
      2. ServoClose(): Locks the door by rotating the servo back to a closed position.
      
   ‚öÉ Interactive Feedback:
      1. Displays messages like "Enter Password," "Door is Open," or "Wrong Password" on the LCD.
      2. Includes a loading() function for dynamic messages with a loading effect.
      
   ‚öÑ Automatic Locking:
     1. After the door is opened, the system waits for a set time before automatically relocking.
     
   ‚öÖ Manual Closure:
    1. Pressing the '#' key closes the door manually.
    
   üîªCode Flow:
      1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup:
          1. Initializes the keypad, servo, and LCD.
          2. Displays a welcome message and prepares the door in a locked state.
      2Ô∏è‚É£ Main Loop:
         Checks if the door is open:
           1. If open, listens for the '#' key to close the door.
           2. If closed, prompts the user to enter the password.
      3Ô∏è‚É£ Password Handling:
          1. Accepts character input from the keypad and displays it on the LCD.
          2. Validates the entered password when the length matches the required size.
          3. Clears input after each attempt.
